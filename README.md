dotbins
=======

Here I keep scripts and utils that live on my *~/.bin* directory. They are currently on a private git repo, so I'm cleaning and importing them.

**They aren't optimal**, but works for my needs. Feel free to suggest improvements on them.

scripts
--------
* **mutefy**: Old script to mute ads on Spotify (when using Alsa). I don't use it anymore, so maybe it isn't working right now;
* **renamer**: Rename all files where invoked, removing whitespaces (and some other trash), in order to ease file handling on command line. Also, the new file name can have all characters in upper or lower case;
* **imgurme**: Parse and download images from an Imgur gallery url;
* **curreios**: Check [Correrios](http://websro.correios.com.br/sro_bin/txect01$.startup?P_LINGUA=001&P_TIPO=001) shipments;
* **update-git**: Update git repositories found on the current directory (with its submodules);
* **completeme**: Use cmake/Bear compilation database file as input to YouCompleteMe (vim).

dotfiles
--------
You can take a look on them on my [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/rodrigogolive/dotfiles) ;)
